# Cosmic Quest - Order and Chaos
This is the repository for *VACATe Game Studios'* capstone project titled *Cosmic Quest - Order and Chaos*. This repository contains all the code for the project, as well as a wiki containing all of the documentation and deliverables.

## Development

### Getting Started

To get started with development, you must have the following dependencies installed:
```
Unity Editor 2019.2.8f1
git
```

In order for git to be able to handle some of the large game files, you must install the Git Large File Storage plugin from the [git-lfs site](https://git-lfs.github.com/). Once you have this installed, go into the root directory of this repository on your computer and run `git lfs install` to setup the proper Git hooks. This only needs to be done once.

### Git Development Strategy

Each developer must work on their own branch (or series of branches), and open a pull request in order to merge their branch to master. You will not be able to push directly to master.

Here is an example workflow:
``` bash
# Create a branch from the current branch
$ git branch my-branch

# Checkout your new branch
$ git checkout my-branch

# Push changes on your branch
$ git push origin my-branch

# Pull the latest changes from master to your branch (may cause merge issues)
$ git pull origin master
```

### Setting up Unity's SmartMerge

One of the main areas for merge conflicts is in files using Unity's YAML format (i.e. Prefabs, scenes, etc.). However, Unity provides a tool that can merge these files from a content-area perspective. The repo is setup to use this tool for merging these files, however you do need to *manually set up the git config so git knows where this tool is*. To do so, simply append the following to `.git/config`:

```
[merge]
    tool = unityyamlmerge
[mergetool "unityyamlmerge"]
    trustExitCode = false
    cmd = <path to UnityYAMLMerge.exe> merge -p "$BASE" "$REMOTE" "$LOCAL" "$MERGED"
```

Replace `<path to UnityYAMLMerge.exe>` with the appropriate path to this tool. The path will look something like this: `'<Unity install directory>\\Editor\\Data\\Tools\\UnityYAMLMerge.exe'` (Remember to escape the backslashes on windows, as seen in the example).

#### Using SmartMerge to resolve merge conflicts

When you have merge conflicts including Unity files (`*.unity`, `*.prefab`, `*.asset`), be sure to first resolve any merge conflicts in any other files such as any `*.cs` files (mergetool can't handle these files and will throw a warning). Once these conflicts are figured out, run the command `git mergetool` and SmartMerge will smoothly handle merging the Unity objects. It will ask you if the merge was successful (a chance for you to check quickly that things look alright), then after it finishes it will create backups with the file ending `*.orig` (if you could remove those before committing that would be great). Once all the merging is sorted out, then run `git add .` to add all of the new changes, then finally `git merge --continue` to complete the merge.
